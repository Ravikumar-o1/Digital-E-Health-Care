# e-health-care

Deep Learning based web portal which support the digital data extraction from medicalgenerated printed reports.
The centralizing the medical  reports data to produce the best possible treatment in the future.


            The healthcare is the big point of concern in the today’s world. There are system which 
    holds the patients data digitally but this system can’t be accessed remotely by the patients. Most of 
    the multi-speciality hospital maintains the records of patients which are never use in the future for 
    any purpose. There are no such system which are actively working globally for the patient’s data 
    handling and analysis. In current scenario, patient visit doctor each time and this data of diagnosis 
    is just kept on piece of paper which may lost anytime. Some diseases of patient depends on past 
    treatment hence it is important to preserve the data of patient during each treatment securely so that 
    doctor can easily access that data and know about the diseases suffered by patient and prescriptions 
    the patient has taken. Depending upon the data doctor can give prescription. Hence to cope up with 
    this problem and to avoid the hectic task of carrying reports along with them, we are motivated to 
    implement this project “E_HealthCare” which will make all the reports and data of patient 
    remotely available to the doctors anytime anywhere. 



The system is implemented using the CNN, LSTM, NODEJS and ANGULAR 6.
